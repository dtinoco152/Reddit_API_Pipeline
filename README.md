# Reddit_API_Pipeline
This repo is a collection of python files with the purpose of collecting info on posts and comments from certain subreddits
and moving them into a GCP bucket and a MongoDB Atlas cluster.

This data could then be accessed either on a local machine or onto a cluster such as DataBricks to conduct machine learning tasks.
