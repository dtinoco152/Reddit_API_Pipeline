# Project Repository
Hello! This repository consists of a collection of projects that encompass a variety of tasks that have been worked by myself
in conjunction with my colleagues where applicable.

The Reddit Folder consists of a DAG pipeline for extracting post and comment data from the Reddit API and saving them onto a
GCP bucket and MongoDB Atlas cluster for the purpose of conducting machine learning goals with Databricks.

The Reports folder includes projects in Experimentation, Time Series and more that were done in collaboration with small groups.
The work with Time Series also won a competition against 30+ teams.
